We do wildlife control work in residences and especially in areas of vegetation suppression to rid the environment and reduce the impact of vegetation suppression on wildlife.

The company has a large team of professionals with extensive experience capturing and relocating venomous animals and others.

For several years AM Fermino has worked with mining companies that have carried out massive deforestation with the use of heavy machinery in the scaring or capture and relocation of animals and marking of trees of historical and cultural value for their preservation, thus contributing to the reduction of impacts on flora and wildlife.

In this area, the company has also captured stray dogs in condominiums and residences to protect human health.
