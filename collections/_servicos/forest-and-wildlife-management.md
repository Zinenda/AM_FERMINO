With a team of capable senior technicians, coordinated by a Forest Engineer authorised to carry out forest inventories, AM Fermino has carried out forest inventories and management plans for areas under simple licences and forestry concessions.

AM Fermino's experience includes preparing faunal management plans, especially for wildlife farms on land and water (crocodile breeding and fattening projects).
