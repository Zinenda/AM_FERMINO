AM Fermino has been a strong partner of the large mining companies of Tete Province in the recovery of degraded areas.

The company has been involved for more than 8 years in recovering coal and loan areas, planting trees, and grasses of different species.

AM Fermino's experience in this area includes the collection of tree and grass seed, its processing and application in flat degraded areas and slopes.

AM Fermino is one of the only (if not the only) company with technicians with knowledge of using biomass in the recovery of slopes from mining tailings.
